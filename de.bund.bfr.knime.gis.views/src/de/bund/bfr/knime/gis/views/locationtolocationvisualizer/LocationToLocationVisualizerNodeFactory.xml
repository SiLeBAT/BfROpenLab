	<name>Location To Location View</name>

	<shortDescription>
		Provides geographic and network visualization of locations with latitude and
		longitude.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			<p>
				This node can visualize a graph of locations with different layouts and in a geographical map.
				The geographical map is read from the table in the first port, that has to contains a column
				with shapes. Additionally a node table in the second port, which contains the IDs, latitudes and
				longitudes of the locations, and an edge table in the third port, that specifies how the
				locations are connected, are needed as input. Any data in the node or edge table can be used for
				highlighting (as explained below).
			</p>
			<p>
				Two views of the graph are available, one showing the graph's structure and the other one its
				geographical representation. These views are synchronized. Whenever the user selects a node or
				edge in one view, its representation in the other view is automatically selected.
