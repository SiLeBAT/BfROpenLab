 * In this tutorial we'll show you how to import delivery data to FoodChain-Lab via our Excel templates.
 * We will first import the initial data for the outbreak locations and then successively add the delivery data for caterers and other suppliers via autogenerated back- and forward-tracing templates.

{% include heading.html text="Step 1" %}

 * Select **Food-Lab > Open DB Gui...** in the menu bar to open the database interface.

{% include heading.html text="Step 2" %}

 * The FoodChain-Lab database interface now pops up.
 * Here you can import, edit and validate food delivery data.
 * To start the data import you must download, fill out and import the "Start Tracing Backward" or  the "Start Tracing Forward" template.
 * Backward: [https://github.com/SiLeBAT/BfROpenLa...](https://github.com/SiLeBAT/BfROpenLabResources/raw/master/GitHubPages/templates/Start_Tracing_Backward.xlsx).
 * Forward: [https://github.com/SiLeBAT/BfROpenLa...](https://github.com/SiLeBAT/BfROpenLabResources/raw/master/GitHubPages/templates/Start_Tracing_Forward.xlsx).

{% include heading.html text="Step 3" %}

 * For this tutorial we have already pre-prepared "Start Tracing Forward" templates for two **Caterers**, at which some contaminated food products were detected.
 * These templates contain deliveries from the **Caterers** to several **Educational Institutions**.
 * Here we start with "Forward" instead of "Backward" templates, since we first want to know the recipients of the **Caterers'** menus and not the suppliers of the ingredients.

{% include heading.html text="Step 4" %}

 * Download the pre-prepared templates.
 * Caterer 1: [https://github.com/SiLeBAT/BfROpenLa...](https://github.com/SiLeBAT/BfROpenLabResources/raw/master/GitHubPages/documents/Start_Tracing_Forward_Caterer1.xlsx)
 * Caterer 2: [https://github.com/SiLeBAT/BfROpenLa...](https://github.com/SiLeBAT/BfROpenLabResources/raw/master/GitHubPages/documents/Start_Tracing_Forward_Caterer2.xlsx)

{% include heading.html text="Step 8" %}

 * In the database interface you'll notice, that there is now data in the tables.
 * Now we want to do a backtracing starting from the caterers to see where they got the ingredient of the meals from.
 * Press the button for generating backtracing templates, which is marked by the red circle.

{% include screenshot.html img="https://github.com/SiLeBAT/BfROpenLabResources/raw/master/GitHubPages/documents/foodchainlab_datacollecting_1/8.png" %}

{% include heading.html text="Step 9" %}

 * Since we want to do the backtracing for the caterers, select **Caterer** only and press **OK**.

{% include heading.html text="Step 12" %}

 * Open the generated template for **Caterer 1**.
 * In the upper part of the sheet you can see all the outgoing deliveries of **Caterer 1**, that were imported with the "Start Forward Template". These deliveries belong to two different lots: "C1M1" and "C1M2".
 * The cells here have grey background. That means that you should not edit them.

{% include screenshot.html img="https://github.com/SiLeBAT/BfROpenLabResources/raw/master/GitHubPages/documents/foodchainlab_datacollecting_1/12.png" %}

{% include heading.html text="Step 13" %}

 * Scroll down to the section where you can enter the ingredient for the two lots.
 * A delivery of "Frozen Strawberries" from "Frozen Fruit Sales" was used as an ingredient in lot "C1M1".
 * So lets enter this delivery here (marked by the red box).
 * Save and close the document.

{% include heading.html text="Step 14" %}

 * Now open the generated template for **Caterer 2**.
 * Analogously to the previous template you can see all the outgoing deliveries of **Caterer 2**.

{% include heading.html text="Step 15" %}

 * Scroll down to the section where you can enter the ingredient for the two lots.
 * Two deliveries of "Frozen Strawberries" from "Frozen Fruit Sales" were used as ingredients in lot "C2M1".
 * Enter the deliveries here (marked by the red box).
 * Then save and close the document.
