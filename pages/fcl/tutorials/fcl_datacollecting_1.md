<h2 class="tutorial">Tasks</h2>

 * In this tutorial we'll show you how to import delivery data to FoodChain-Lab via our Excel templates.
 * We will first import the initial data for the outbreak locations and then successively add the delivery data for caterers and other suppliers via autogenerated back- and forward-tracing templates.
 * In FoodChain-Lab it is also possible to import the whole delivery network from one Excel file, but that procedure is not documented here as it is advantageous. The underlying "All In One Template" can be downloaded from here: <a href="https://github.com/SiLeBAT/BfROpenLabResources/raw/master/GitHubPages/templates/All_In_One_Template.xlsx" target="_blank">https://github.com/SiLeBAT/BfROpenLab...</a>.

<h2 class="tutorial">Step 1</h2>

 * Select <b>Food-Lab > Open DB Gui...</b> in the menu bar to open the database interface.

<h2 class="tutorial">Step 2</h2>

 * The FoodChain-Lab database interface now pops up.
 * Here you can import, edit and validate food delivery data.
 * To start the data import you must download, fill out and import the "Start Tracing Template".
 * It can be downloaded from here: <a href="https://github.com/SiLeBAT/BfROpenLabResources/raw/master/GitHubPages/templates/Start_Tracing_Template.xlsx" target="_blank">https://github.com/SiLeBAT/BfROpenLab...</a>.

<h2 class="tutorial">Step 3</h2>

 * For this tutorial we have already pre-prepared a "Start Tracing Template".
 * Download it from <a href="https://github.com/SiLeBAT/BfROpenLabResources/raw/master/GitHubPages/documents/Start_Tracing_Caterers.xlsx" target="_blank">https://github.com/SiLeBAT/BfROpenLab...</a>.
 * In the <b>Stations</b> sheet of this file several <b>Educational Institutions</b> and two <b>Caterers</b> are defined.

<h2 class="tutorial">Step 4</h2>

 * Cases of a disease were reported at the <b>Educational Institutions</b>, which received their menus from the <b>Caterers</b>.
 * The deliveries from the <b>Caterers</b> to the <b>Educational Institutions</b> are defined in the <b>Deliveries</b> sheet.
