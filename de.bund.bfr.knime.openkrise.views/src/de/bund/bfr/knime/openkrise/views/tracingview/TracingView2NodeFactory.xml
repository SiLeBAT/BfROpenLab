	<name>Tracing View</name>

	<shortDescription>
		Provides visualization of supply chains and allows forward and backward tracing.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			This node can visualize a supply chain. The three mandatory input ports expect a station
			table, an delivery table and a delivery relations table. These tables are provided by the Supply
			Chain Analyzer. Tracing can be performed by setting the following four properties for stations
			and deliveries: "Case Weight", "Cross Contamination", "Kill Contamination" and "Observed". You
			can change the property values by double clicking on a station/delivery or by using
			"Station/Delivery Selection -> Show Properties" from the context menu. Based on these properties
			the following values are computed: "Score", "Normalized Score", "Positive Score", "Negative
			Score", "Forward", "Backward". The results of the tracing or any other data from input tables can
			be visualized by using highlighting (as explained below).
