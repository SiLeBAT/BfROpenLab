		<intro>
			<p>
				This station can visualize a graph of locations with different layouts and in a geographical
				map. The geographical map is read from the table in the first port, that has to contains a
				column with shapes. Additionally a station table in the second port, which contains the IDs,
				latitudes and longitudes of the locations, and an delivery table in the third port, that
				specifies how the locations are connected, are needed as input. Any data in the station or
				delivery table can be used for highlighting (as explained below).
			</p>
			<p>
				Two views of the graph are available, one showing the graph's structure and the other one its
				geographical representation. These views are synchronized. Whenever the user selects a station
				or delivery in one view, its representation in the other view is automatically selected.
