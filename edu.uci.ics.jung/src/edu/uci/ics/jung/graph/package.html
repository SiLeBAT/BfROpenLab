<p>Interfaces for the JUNG graph types, and some representative implementations.</p>

<P>A graph consists of a set of vertices set and a set of edges which connect the
vertices.  The base interface is <code>Hypergraph</code>, which defines the most
general type of graph; other interfaces (<code>Graph</code>, <code>DirectedGraph</code>, etc.)
define more restrictive graph types.
<p>Vertex and edge types are specified at compile type using Java 1.5 generics.  

<p>Types of graphs which are supported include (but are not limited to)
<ul>
<li/>edges (these have have exactly two endpoints, which may or may not be distinct)
<li/>self-loops (edges which connect exactly one vertex)
<li> directed and undirected edges
<li> vertices and edges with attributes (for example, weighted edges)
<li> vertices and edges with different constraints or properties (examples: trees, bipartite 
     graphs, or multimodal)
<li> parallel edges (multiple edges which connect a single set of vertices)
<li> internal representations as matrices or as adjacency lists or adjacency maps
<li/>internal representations that order their elements according to insertion time,
natural ordering, or a specified <code>Comparator</code>
</ul> 
Extensions or implementations of this interface 
may enforce or disallow any or all of these variations.
<p><b>Notes</b>:
<ul>
<li/> The collections returned by graph instances
should be treated in general as if read-only.  While they are not contractually 
guaranteed (or required) to be immutable,
these interfaces do not define the outcome if they are mutated.
Mutations should be done via <code>{add,remove}{Edge,Vertex}</code>, or
in the constructor.
<li/> "Wrapper" graphs are available through <code>GraphDecorator</code>; these are useful
if you want to create a graph implementation that uses another implementation to do the work,
and adds some extra behavior.  (One example: <code>ObservableGraph</code>, which notifies 
registered listeners when graph mutations occur.)
</ul>
