	<shortDescription>
      	Provides forward and backward tracing.

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			This node can visualize a supply chain. The three input ports expect a node/station table,
			an edge/delivery table and a data table. These tables are provided by the Supply Chain Analyzer.
			Tracing can be performed by setting the following three properties for nodes/stations or
			edges/deliveries: "Case Weight", "Cross Contamination" and "Filter". Each of the properties can
			be set in the respective tab. Based on the properties the following values are computed: "Score",
			"Forward", "Backward".
		</intro>

		<tab name="Properties">
			<option name="Station Weights">
				Weights for stations. The computed scores are based on these weights.
			</option>
			<option name="Delivery Weights">
				Weights for deliveries. The computed scores are based on these weights.
			</option>
			<option name="Station Cross Contamination">
				Set cross contamination for stations. That means all incoming deliveries can
				contaminate all outgoing deliveries (see "Enforce Temporal Order").
			</option>
			<option name="Delivery Cross Contamination">
				Set cross contamination for deliveries. Similar to "Station Cross
				Contamination", but unselected (no cross contamination) incoming deliveries and outgoing
				deliveries, that are only connected to unselected incoming deliveries, are excluded from the
				cross contamination.
			</option>
			<option name="Station Filter">
				For all stations/deliveries that can reached by forward/backward tracing from
				stations selected here, the "Forward"/"Backward" property is set to true.
			</option>
			<option name="Edge Filter">
				For all stations/deliveries that can reached by forward/backward tracing from
				deliveries selected here, the "Forward"/"Backward" is set to true.
			</option>
		</tab>
		<tab name="Options">
			<option name="Enforce Temporal Order">
				If checked, the delivery date is used for cross contamination. That means a
				delivery can only contaminate deliveries with a later date.
			</option>
			<option name="Filter">
				Allows to apply a filter to all stations/deliveries. Only filtered
				stations/deliveries are shown in the table.
			</option>
			<option name="Clear">
				Clears the input in the table. True/false values are set to false and numbers
				are set to zero.
			</option>
			<option name="Set All">
				Sets all the values for all filtered stations/deliveries to "true"/"specfied
				value".
			</option>
