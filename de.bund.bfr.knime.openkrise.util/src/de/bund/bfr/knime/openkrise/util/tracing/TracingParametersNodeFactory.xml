	<shortDescription>
      	Provides forward and backward tracing.

		<intro>
			This node can visualize a supply chain. The three input ports expect a node/station table,
			an edge/delivery table and a data table. These tables are provided by the Supply Chain Analyzer.
			Tracing can be performed by setting the following three properties for nodes/stations or
			edges/deliveries: "Case Weight", "Cross Contamination" and "Filter". Each of the properties can
			be set in the respective tab. Based on the properties the following values are computed: "Score",
			"Forward", "Backward".
		</intro>
		<tab name="Options">
			<option name="Filter">
				Allows to apply a filter to all nodes/edges. Only filtered nodes/edges are
				shown in the table.
			</option>
			<option name="Clear">
				Clears the input in the table. True/false values are set to false and numbers
				are set to zero.
			</option>
			<option name="Set All">
				Sets all the values for all filtered nodes/edges to "true"/"specfied value".
			</option>
		</tab>
		<tab name="Properties">
			<option name="Node Weights">
				Weights for nodes/stations. The computed scores are based on these weights.
			</option>
			<option name="Edge Weights">
				Weights for edges/deliveries. The computed scores are based on these weights.
			</option>
			<option name="Node Cross Contamination">
				Set cross contamination for nodes/stations.
			</option>
			<option name="Edge Cross Contamination">
				Set cross contamination for edges/deliveries.
			</option>
			<option name="Node Filter">
				For all nodes/edges that can reached by forward/backward tracing from nodes
				selected here, the "Forward"/"Backward" is set to true.
			</option>
			<option name="Edge Filter">
				For all nodes/edges that can reached by forward/backward tracing from edges
				selected here, the "Forward"/"Backward" is set to true.
			</option>
